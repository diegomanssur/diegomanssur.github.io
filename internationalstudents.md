# International Students in Canada: 2015-2023

<img src="images/is_study.jpg?raw=true"/>

In the past 8 years, immigration laws and the education system have drastically changed in order to welcome a higher number of international students. However, the government of Canada has recently annouced that new regulations and rules will be implemented in the future for students visas in order to alleviate the current housing crisis.

We will explore and discover the different international student's trends from 2015 to 2023 using MySQL, as well as visualizing our findings using Tableau in order to understand the impact in the Canadian education and housing market.

The following dataset has been provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada

## International Students - Nationalities Segmentation

This section of the study will focus on the table called international_students_Canada, which provides us with information about the different countries international students have come between 2015 and 2023.

### Viewing Data
In order to explore and organize our data, we need to take a look and understand it. This way we can find inconsistencies or errors we can clean in the process.

### Deleting hearders from data
After taking a closer look at the data, I couldn't find any issues or mistakes. However, I did have issues importing the table into MySQL Workbench, specifically the headers becoming part of the data. This can be fixed using the following query:

### Number of Countries that contributed with international students between 2015 and 2023

While reviewing the data, I could easily see that there weree many countries that had 0 international students coming to Canada. I wouldn't consider this an error, so filtering the non-contributor countries out of our study will definitely help us with future calculations. The following query and subquery helps us identify and count how many countries actually contribute with international students in Canada.

### Total number of international students between 2015 and 2023
I thought it would be interesting to now the exact number of international students Canada has received in the past 8 years. This number will help us with other type of analysis later on.

### Top 5 Nationalities: 2015 - 2023
With this query, we identify the 5 countries that contributed with the most international students. Just to clarify, the sum of the values doesn't reflect the total number of international students Canada has received between 2015-2023.

### Bottom 5 Nationalities: 2015-2023

Just as the query above, exploring the 5 countries that contributed with less students in the past 8 years is an interesting finding that could help us understand future trends and policies in the education system.

### Creating Pivot Table

Creating a pivot table with the column names inverted will help us calculate the growth of international students each year in the next section, where we find the growth and porcentage numbers.

### Growth Percentage of international students per year compared to 2015

By using a Windows Function like LAG, we can get the right numbers from the previous year and calculate the student's growth. We can as well use the same calculation and turn it into a porcentage, which will be useful for visualization purposes.

## International Students - Province Segmentation
This section of the study will be focused on the table called international_students_Province_Canada, which provides us with information about the different Canadian provinces international students have come to between 2015 and 2023. We also have data about gender per provinces.

### View Data from second table
In order to explore and organize our data, we need to take a look and understand it. This way we can find inconsistencies or errors we can clean in the process.
